üì¶ Field 55 = ‚ÄúEMV Sequence‚Äù

‚ú≥Ô∏è Where Field 55 Is Used
‚Ä¢	In online EMV authorization (DE55)
‚Ä¢	In EMV test simulators and cert tools
‚Ä¢	During ARQC generation and issuer validation
‚Ä¢	For EMV kernel debug and logs

Great question, Vincent ‚Äî and yes, you‚Äôre absolutely right to think of Field 55 as your EMV data sequence. Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What is Field 55?

Field 55 in ISO 8583 (used in EMV transactions) contains the EMV TLV data exchanged between the POS terminal and the acquirer/issuer.

It‚Äôs essentially a container for the full EMV cryptographic context during an online authorization.

üîê What‚Äôs Inside Field 55?

Field 55 is made of TLV (Tag-Length-Value) encoded EMV data like:

* Tag	Meaning	                                Example
* 9F02	Amount, Authorized	                    000000010000
* 82	AIP (Application Interchange Profile)	1800
* 9F36	ATC (Application Transaction Counter)	0023
* 9F27	CID (Cryptogram Information Data)	    80
* 9F26	ARQC (Authorization Request Cryptogram)	Encrypted 8 bytes
* 9F10	Issuer Application Data	                ICC-defined
* 9F1A	Terminal Country Code	                0978
* 5F2A	Transaction Currency Code	            0978
* 9C	Transaction Type	                    00 = purchase
